## War Card Game(User vs. Computer):
*_It is a two player game that splits a standard deck of cards into equal face downpiles for each player. For each turn, both
players flip over the top card from their pile and the player with the higher card
takes both cards. If their top cards have the same value, they place their next top card face down, and flip the following
card. The winners gets all six cards. If there is no winner, they repeat the process. To win the game, a player must take
all the cards from their opponent.*
